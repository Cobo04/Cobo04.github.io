Flashcard dynamic dataset construction overview:

1. A main list will contain all individual flashcard sets for the time being
    ┕━━> [ [flashSet1], [flashSet2], ... , [flashSetN] ]
    ┕━━> Once enough sets are created, this method becomes very inneficient, but that will be fixed at a later date

2. Each individual set will follow the following structure
    ┕━━> [ [setDescriptorData], [flashCards] ]
        ┕━━> Where setDescriptorData contains the creator name, set name, and set description for a total of 3 elements
            ┕━━> [ creatorName, setName, setDescription ]
        ┕━━> flashCards follows the structure [ [term1, definition1], [term2, definition2], ... , [termN, definitionN] ]

3. An example of a complete data structure for a container of multiple flashcard sets will follow as shown below:
    
    mainL = [                                   ━━> Main Set Container

        [                                       ━━> Individual flashcard set

            [                                   ━━> setDescriptorData (see 2.1.1)
                creatorName,
                setName,
                setDescription
            ],

            [                                   ━━> Set-Specific flashcard container (see 2.2)
                [ term1, definition1 ],         ━━> Term-Definition pair
                [ term2, definition2 ],             
                [ term3, definition3 ],
            ]

        ],

        [                                       ━━> Another main set container; this structure repeats until N total sets have been loaded

            [
                creatorName,
                setName,
                setDescription
            ],

            [
                [ term1, definition1 ],
                [ term2, definition2 ],
                [ term3, definition3 ],
            ]

        ]

    ]

4. Indexing individual pieces of data within the set database will use numerical values. Cope, J :point: :rofl:
    ┕━━> Individual set lists:                                      mainL[i]

    ┕━━> setDescriptorData:                                         mainL[i][0]
        ┕━━> creatorName:                                           mainL[i][0][0]
        ┕━━> setName:                                               mainL[i][0][1]
        ┕━━> setDescription:                                        mainL[i][0][2]

    ┕━━> Set-Specific flashcard container:                          mainL[i][1]
    ┕━━> Set-Specific flashcard Term-Definition pair:               mainL[i][1][n]
        ┕━━> Set-Specific flashcard Term:                           mainL[i][1][n][0]
        ┕━━> Set-Specific flashcard Definition:                     mainL[i][1][n][1]
