                Criticisms of GDP as an indicator of International Development

                Following the worldwide economic collapse caused by the intensity of the Great Depression, countries around the world found themselves in a position in need of a method that was able to track growth and prosperity over an extended period of time.  Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, was adopted by the United Nations and ultimately spread around the world as the leading indicator of economic and national development as a result.  However, after multiple years of usage within the international community, many prominent advocates began to highlight the criticisms of GDP and its lack of measurements with regards to certain social contexts.

                <br><br>Over the course of world modernization, Gross Domestic Product has been criticized due to its inability to account for wealth inequality within specific nation-states as well as the exclusion of non-marketized labor.  According to the Economist, “By convention GDP measures only output that is bought and sold.” By looking at GDP through the lens of a social critic, developmental measurement within the global community lacks specific evaluations dealing with wealth inequality and the policies made thereof.  Rather than accepting the fact that an imbalance of wealth exists and therefore intensely skews the overall GDP of a country, social critics state that legislative policy makers trust GDP in its entirety to eliminate poverty.  This, however, comes with the notion that any sense of looking beyond GDP as the prime tool of developmental measurement must be ignored.  Social critics state that for the development of a nation to be truly measured, poverty must be addressed directly, wealth inequality needs to be made apparent, and the scope of GDP needs to take the depth of social context in a particular region into account.

                <br><br>Apart from the lack of social makeup, critics also argue from a feminist perspective that the exclusion of unpaid household labor causes GDP to be an ineffective indicator of international development.  This barred measurement synthesizes a heavy skew that causes GDP as a measurement of growth to be ineffective when accounting for labor that does not contribute directly to the economic market in question.  Whether it is unnoted agrarian labor taking place in political units scoured with vast fields, or simple chores with the goal of increasing the efficiency of daily life, feminist critics state that a prioritization of purely economic factors disregard these jobs that are ultimately unaccounted for in GDP measurement.  Through a visualization of the major flaws in GDP as a measurement of international development as seen through the lenses of structurally different critics, there is an inherent need for international organizations to adopt new forms of measurement, embodying a modernized sense of cultural understanding.

                <br><br>The United Nations should use metrics focused primarily on the capabilities and developmental practices of human nature alongside GDP to better measure international growth.  To gauge a country’s developmental process in a way that incorporates more than economic strength, factors such as education, life expectancy, and average income of a household can be analyzed to provide this medium, known as the “Human Developmental” approach. These values are expressed in a way such that the main point of focus is placed on the citizens within a country and their overall well-being, rather than simply a number to estimate the abilities of its population.  Alongside this idea, the capabilities of a person contributing to society can be examined to discover alternative methods of measurement.  According to Stephen Macekura in his “Measuring Development” lecture, Indian economist Amartya Sen stated, “...The purpose of development should be to unlock human ‘capabilities,’ not just generate economic growth.”  This notion comes with the overall idea that there truly is no one way to measure progress within a nation state, but rather a series of capabilities that are possessed within each citizen, straying the reliance of measurement away from one, single number.

                <br><br>These capabilities come in the form of various freedoms possessed by the actors that cover a wide variety of life under governmental control, such as social opportunities, protective assurances, and economic structure.  While it has been made clear through these unique approaches that GDP only selects its developmental indicators through a narrow viewpoint, certain nation states are able to incorporate other factors related specifically to the citizen to varietize their growth models.
