                Realist and Liberal Internationalist Interpretations of Modern U.S.-China Relations
            </div>

                In the modern era, the United States and China have a relationship that can be viewed from the scope of two major international relations theories: realism and liberal internationalism.  When viewed from these separate perspectives, the preconceived notions of each respective state can be analyzed and categorized into the methods in which they take to achieve their goals.  Through these distinctive procedures of inquiry unique to each perspective, the ways in which each state avoids conflict, engages in global cooperation, and, ultimately, interacts with each other, are highlighted within a given contextual background.

                <br><br>From a realist’s perspective, the modern relationship between the United States and China can be simplified down to the interpretations of power relative to each respective state.  Specifically, the actions taken by the United States and China represent long-term moves to increase their power on a national scale that entertains a sophisticated bipolarity.  Whether it’s engaging in international trade, sending and receiving diplomats, or addressing the world on a critical national issue, the outcome is consciously and meticulously manipulated to successfully address a short-term issue that contributes towards a more outstanding long-term goal.  As stated by Stephen Macekura, “Realists tend to treat power as separate from, and predominant over morality, ideology, and other social and economic aspects of life.”  By accurately placing current issues below the constant search for power, a realist’s perspective would state that the United States and China essentially secure their spots in a bipolar system of international order.  Simply stated, a realist would view this dynamic as each state working individually and autonomously towards their own self interests, without necessary regard to collaboration.  The consistent goal to achieve this success creates a dynamic between the two countries that distributes the power of them equally within the international system.  
                
                <br><br>This, however, comes from a strenuous slew of components related to power acquisition, such as GDP and geography.  More specifically, the relationship of China and the United States can be viewed within the scope of these components, demonstrating the applicability of legislative decisions employed by national policymakers.  Certain policy decisions can impact the way that the other country views them, shifting the power dynamic to an imbalance that requires executive action to avoid unipolarity and maintain their status as a world power.  A realist would also state that the lack of central world authority and the existence of anarchy within states contributes to “a security dilemma that minimizes the risk of conflict between the two countries.”  Along with this, a consistent stream of communication between the United States and China is required to reduce the likelihood of war, conflict, and escalated tension between them.  From a realist’s perspective, the chance of conflict can be minimized through executive actions related to the specific country’s power.

                <br><br>In drastic contrast to realism, a liberal internationalist would use the progressive scope of cooperation as a tool to analyze the fluidity of relations between the United States and China.  Kevin Macekura states that “cooperation is rational, desirable, and durable.” Together, these points construct a set of methods that can be used collaboratively between nations to achieve shared goals, adding to the liberalist concept that issues at hand can be viewed as evolutionary, or changing over time as more assistance is received.  A liberal internationalist would use this underlying notion of cooperation and evolution to showcase how the United States and China ultimately find themselves moving towards the ideal end of true prosperity.  However, the methods in which they find themselves achieving this main goal is primarily dependent on the type of regime employed by the respective government.  
                
                <br><br>The communist state of China would see the means to a specific end drastically different than that of the capitalist United States.  This is seen within the difference in interpretations of trade and non-governmental organizations between the two countries.  Tim Dunne states that governments worldwide are required to essentially set certain new markets and organizations of their country so that they “are hospitable to the needs of the imperial power.”  A liberal internationalist would state that these interpretations construct the relationship between the United States and China, with a higher trade connection being directly proportional to generous prosperity and effective collaboration.  To avoid conflict, a liberal internationalist would claim that conflict seems irrational when the countries have deeply rooted trade connections.  To minimize the risk of war, the United States and China could, setting their difference in regime types aside, find common ground in sophisticated trade networks that heavily affect both economies.
